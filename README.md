# General-Data-Driven-Adaptive-Learning
This is the research project on pure data-driven adaptive learning methods. Preparing for NIPS 2019.<br><br>

This project is a further improvement on our Trajectory-Reweighted_Sampler project. However, in this project we made two major changes: firstly, we are updating the weights of loss contribution of each data point to adaptively learn the model instead of directly over-/under-sample the data itself, and secondly, we design our model into standard PyTorch library style so that researchers can plug our reweighting code into theirs without any extra modification. These two changes enable our model to be a general adaptively learning framework which can be applied to any tasks.<br><br>

The most significant contribution of our model is that it automatically learns the hidden structure of the dataset. In previous works, there are many tailored models that deal with certain specific dataset configurations, like imbalanced dataset, noisy dataset or easy/hard dataset and achieve better performance over unattended models. However, the application of these models require people to know the properties of the dataset a priori, and most of them work worse on clean dataset and datasets with different configurations. Our model, however, doesn't require and prior knowledge of the dataset and performs equally well on clean datasets. That means it is a general training framework and can be used with little constraint.
